------------------|------------
`rules.txt`         | The main list
`wp-restyle2.txt`   | Restyles Wikipedia to make more use of on-screen space (doesn't leave a vertical bar all the way down the page)
`ytbs.txt`          | On Youtube, hides bullshit content from the suggestions sidebar (& maybe the after-video player links, YouTube don't keep breaking that)
`ytdf.txt`          | Emulates the Youtube Distraction-Free addon. Various small QoL improvements
